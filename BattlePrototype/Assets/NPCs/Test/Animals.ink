== birth_of_peach_tree ==
You are born when a grain of pollen clinging to the leg of a honeybee falls into the open blossom of an ancient peach tree at the very back of an unkempt orchard somewhere in North America. As spring turns to summer, the petals of the blossom fall, and the fruit of a golden peach begins to swell in its place. You, fetus and seed, grow nestled in the center of the warm peach fruit, surrounded by sweet flesh. As summer passes, the fruit around you ripens. A child wearing a blue dress pauses while taking a shortcut through your orchard to contemplate the fuzzy golden fruit hangin just above her head. ->picking_peaches
=picking_peaches
*   Allow the child to pick your fruit. 
The child plucks you from the branch and eats the sticky sweet flesh as she walks. She sucks the last drop of juice from the pit, your shell, before tossing you into a stream.
*   Don't allow yourself to be picked. 
The child plucks you from the branch and eatsthe sticky sweet flesh as she walks. Did you really think you had any choice in this? You are nothing more than the silent seed in the senter of a peach pit. The child sucks the last drop of juice from your shell before tossing you into a stream.

You float down the stream before lodging in the mud of the bank. A lucky squirel finds you there, burries you, forgets about you. You spend the harsh winter burried in the ground. You freeze, you crack. In the spring, you thaw, and the thaw triggers events within you. You put out a shoot, and it pushes its way up, towards the air, towards the sun. You put out a root, and it digs deep, deeper, seeking the water that will be your lifeblood. You nearly die your first year, uncultivated, uncared for. But in that wild place you cling to life with each stringy root. Your second year is easier. In five years you have grown into a strong tree, producing fruit of your own on your unpruned branches. 
You begin to see more people pass by your glade. The place near the stream where you were planted by an industrious squirel has become a popular picnic spot. On a hot summer day, a small family lays a blanket in your shade. they pick fruit from your branches to eat with their sandwiches. After they eat, the father naps in the shade while the mother cools her feet in the stream. Their two small children explore the glade, gathering rocks and sticks. You watch as they crack open the pits from your fruit, and watch in horror as the youngest places the soft seed into her mouth. Your offspring contains enough cyanide that this afternoon snock could mean the death of both babies. 
*   You cry out a warning
*   You do nothing

->cannot_cry
=cannot_cry
You cannot cry out. You have no voice, no way to warn the parents as the child swallows your poisoned seed. You can only watch as the child begins to struggle to breath, to vomit, to shake. You can only watch as the parents scoop their baby up and run out of your glen to their car. They leave their picnic blanket behind, spread out beneath your branches, and never return for it. A homeless man finds it there and carries it off with him.
Years pass. 
At 18 years, you are old for a peach tree. Most of your branches are dead. Those few still bearing fruit produce only small, stunted fruits that are no longer very sweet. You are cut down by a government contractor building a paved walkway along the river for joggers and bikers and people walking their dogs. Your life ends.
You have died.

== Birth_of_Mallard ==
You are born twice. Your first birth is when your mother lays her egg in a nest of twigs and down near an isolated a mountain lake. Her watchful incubation brought about your second birth. You broke from your eggshell fortress already capable of walking and swimming on the lake. In the first months of your life, you stay near your mother, protected, warm, and fed. You learn from her about your surroundings, about the dangers of predators. As you grow older, you grow bolder. You begin to move farther from your mother's feathers. There is a day when you wander farther than you have before. You notice a patch of red berries.
*   Move towards the berries
You investigate the berry patch. You nibble at the fruit and find that is it sweet. Your mother notices that you are missing and begins to call for you. you turn and return quickly to the safe company of your mother and siblings.
->adult_mallard  
*   Go back to your mother
Fearing the danger of the unknown, you turn back towards your mother and the safety of her wings. In your hurry, you fail to notice the large raccoon that snatches you up by the neck as you pass. The raccoon does not recognize your autonomy, your identity. He is hungry. You are dead before you have time to cry out, before your mother even notices your absence. 
->welcome_to_reincarnation 
*   Go in another direction
You move towards the lake to float in water that is so still it perfectly reflects the sky and mountains around it. You, too, are reflected in the water, and you look down at your reflection. Were you human, this moment of perfect stillness might have caused you a moment of mindfullness, of inward reflection, meditation, comtemplation. Were you human, you might have begun to comprehend the vastness of the universe, the smallness of yourself, and the futility of time, attachment, and ego. But you are not human. Your tiny brain cannot even comprehend that the blob of color on the surface of the lake is a representation of yourself. You peck feebly at the water, hoping the image might prove a source of food.

= adult_mallard
In this isolated place, you do not see a human being until you begin to fly, learning migration patterns that pass through populated cities. In your first year, you are fed bread by childen while you float on an urban pond. In your second year, you learn about hunters as one of your fellows is shot from the sky with a sound like the earth is cracking open.  
In your first breeding year, you attempt to find a mate. A tawny brown female catches your eye. 
*   Court the female

you pair with a tawny brown female. You keep close to her, your mate. The two of you are closely bonded. You stay with her until she lays her eggs
